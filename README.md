BANGKIT ACADEMY 2023 BATCH 2 PRODUCT CAPSTONE

Rumah Ikan is an app to redesign freshwater fish farming practices, addressing time, effort, and financial barriers to reignite household interest.

# Background
A 58% decline in household-level freshwater fish farms from 2012 to 2021 highlights challenges in income and sustainability. High time investment, financial constraints, and evolving interests contribute to the decline. Our mission: Redesign freshwater fish farming practices, addressing time, effort, and financial barriers to reignite household interest.

# Reason
Recognizing the financial struggles in rural households, our team developed the Rumah Ikan app. Our approach involves modernizing fish farming practices, making it more appealing to the new generation.
